# Installation

This section provides detailed instructions for setting up the project and configuring the environment.

## Prerequisites

- PHP 7.2 or higher
- Composer installed
- OpenAPI Generator (if you want to regenerate SDKs)

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Run the following command to install PHP dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment:**

   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
     
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
     
   - Generate the application key:
     
     ```bash
     php artisan key:generate
     ```

4. **Set API Key:**

   Update the `.env` file with your API key:

   ```
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Run Migrations:**

   If the project uses a database, run migrations:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

6. **Start Development Server:**

   Start the Laravel development server:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## OpenAPI Documentation and SDK Generation

The project includes an OpenAPI specification file (`openapi.yaml`) that describes the API for the streaming video service (entities **Movie** and **Review**).  
Using this file, the following are generated:
- **Client SDK**: for integrating with the API.
- **Server Stub**: (e.g., in Laravel) for further API development.
